# Patrolling_Robot
In this study, we propose a robot security patrol that employs a night vision camera to defend
any premises. The robotic vehicle is equipped with the ESP-32 CAM for night vision. It
patrols along a preset route using a predefined line. The system employs the following
IR-based route system to patrol the assigned field, called a line follower system. To detect an
intruder, it watches the designated area by the camera mounted on a Servo Motor, which
rotates 360 degrees. It searches the surroundings with its camera to identify any human faces.
To secure the facility, we propose a completely autonomous security robot that works
continuously and patrols large regions on its own. The night vision camera is crucial in
making the robotic gadget autonomous. Control and automation are crucial and developing
components of robotics, which is a modern technology that is revolutionising human
existence.
